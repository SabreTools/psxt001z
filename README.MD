# psxt001z

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/SabreTools/psxt001z/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SabreTools/psxt001z/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml)

This library is a mostly-complete port of the [tool of the same name](https://github.com/Dremora/psxt001z) by [Dremora](https://github.com/Dremora/). This currently compiles as a library and does not feature any of the direct disc reading that the original tool did. There are aspirations to changes this in the future.
